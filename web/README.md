# Orrery Web Console

Production web console for the Orrery agent platform — see
[AEP-019](../docs/enhancements/aep-019-web-console.md).

This is an **isolated Node toolchain**, not a member of the Python `uv`
workspace. It builds to a static bundle that the FastAPI front door
(`core/orrery_core/serving/server.py`) serves from `serving/static/` behind the
same JWT auth as the API. `make test` (Python) never touches Node.

Built with **React + Vite + TypeScript** and styled with **Tailwind CSS v4**
(`@tailwindcss/vite`) + `@tailwindcss/typography` for rendered markdown. Dark
mode follows the OS (`prefers-color-scheme`); there is no manual toggle.

The UI is an app shell: a **left sidebar** (brand, New chat, Run triage,
conversation history, identity), a **chat column** in the middle, and a
**right inspector panel** (Tool calls table + Triage report) that toggles from
the header. Conversation history is kept **client-side** in `localStorage`
(the server has no "list sessions" endpoint) — each entry stores the full
transcript plus the server-issued `sessionId`.

## Status

Milestone 1 — an authenticated chat console:

- Bearer-token gate (paste the dev JWT from `make run-assistant-api`)
- Chat against `POST /chat`, threading the server-issued `session_id`
- Identity + role badge (viewer / operator / admin), decoded client-side for
  display — the server remains authoritative for RBAC
- **Tool calls table** (`GET /session/{id}/activity`): every recorded tool
  execution — time, tool, agent, status — in the right inspector panel, so the
  orchestration is visible instead of an opaque paragraph
- **Confirmation panel** (`GET /confirmations/pending`): when a guarded tool
  is awaiting the caller's decision, an Approve/Deny panel renders inline. The
  buttons send the literal words `approve`/`deny` through the normal chat
  flow — the server's requester-verified gate stays the sole authority
- **Conversation history** sidebar — client-side, titled from the first
  message; New chat starts a fresh session
- Loading, error, and auth-expiry states

Milestone 2 — triage view:

- **Run triage** sidebar button — one click sends the full-sweep prompt to the
  `incident_triage_agent`
- **Verdict report** (`GET /session/{id}/triage`): the recorded severity
  (healthy / degraded / critical) as a color-coded badge with the full triage
  report rendered as prose in the inspector's Triage tab, which auto-opens when
  a verdict lands
- **Live tool calls**: while a request is in flight the table is polled every
  2.5s, so multi-specialist sweeps become visible as each specialist completes

Remaining: per-system status chips, the remediation-loop trace (batch
workflow only today), and Milestone 3 (onboarding wizard).

## Run

From the repo root, wrapped as Make targets (one command each):

```bash
make run-console     # build the SPA + serve it behind the API at http://localhost:8000
make web-dev         # Vite dev server on :5173 with hot reload (proxies /chat to :8000)
make web-install     # npm ci
```

`make run-console` is the production-like path (same-origin, single port). For
fast iteration use two terminals — `make run-assistant-api` and `make web-dev` —
then mint a token with `make dev-token` and paste it into the gate.

The underlying npm scripts still work directly if you prefer:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` to override the API base or dev proxy.

## Quality gate

```bash
make web-check       # lint + format + typecheck + test + build (mirrors CI)
make web-fmt         # prettier --write .
```

CI runs `make web-check` in a dedicated `web` job (see
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so the gate is defined once and matches local.
Underlying scripts: `npm run check`, `npm run test:watch`, `npm run build`.

## Layout

```
src/
  api/           HTTP client + wire types (mirror server.py; will be OpenAPI-generated)
  auth/          token storage, JWT display-decode, role mapping, useAuth
  chat/          useChat controller (drives the active conversation) + message types
  conversations/ client-side history store (useConversations + types)
  components/     app shell — Sidebar, ChatConsole, MessageList, MessageInput,
                  InspectorPanel, ToolCallsTable, TriageReport, ConfirmationPanel,
                  TokenGate, IdentityBadge; severity.ts (shared badge classes)
  styles/         Tailwind entry (@import "tailwindcss") + a little custom CSS
  test/           vitest setup (jsdom shims)
```

## Design notes

- **The console never makes access decisions.** The JWT is decoded client-side
  only to display the subject and role; every request is re-verified server-side
  and RBAC re-derives the role. The confirmation panel is a thin renderer over
  the gate's pending payload — the browser sends the decision word + token, and
  the server decides who may approve (requester-only, args-pinned, TTL'd).
- **Same-origin by default.** `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is empty in production because
  FastAPI serves the bundle itself; a full URL is only for cross-origin dev.
- **Types are hand-maintained for now.** `src/api/types.ts` mirrors the FastAPI
  models; AEP-019 will generate them from the OpenAPI schema so the compiler
  catches contract drift.
