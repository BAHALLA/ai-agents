"""Guardrails for tool execution safety.

Provides before_tool_callback factories that gate operations requiring confirmation.
Tools are classified with two levels:
  - @destructive("reason") — dangerous, irreversible operations (delete, drop, etc.)
  - @confirm("reason")     — mutating but non-destructive operations (create, update, etc.)

Unmarked tools are treated as safe and execute immediately.

Two confirmation modes:
  - **Model-mediated (default)** — the gate blocks the first call and tells the
    model to ask the user; a re-call with the same args in a *new* invocation is
    treated as confirmed. Simple, works everywhere, but ultimately trusts the
    model to actually have asked.
  - **Requester-verified (strict)** — active when a transport stamps
    ``_confirmation_strict`` into session state (see
    ``AgentGateway(verified_confirmation=True)``). The gate additionally
    requires a *human* decision: the gateway records an explicit approval
    message (a deliberate word — "approve"/"confirm"/"proceed"/… — a casual
    "ok" doesn't count) stamped with the sender, and the gate only passes when
    that sender is the same verified actor who triggered the pending action.
    Fail-closed: no decision, an unknown requester, or a second person's
    approval all refuse.

ADK calls before_tool_callback with keyword args:
    callback(tool=..., args=..., tool_context=...)

# deliberate: guarded tools are routinely reached *through an AgentTool* (the
# chat root delegates to a specialist), and every AgentTool call runs the
# sub-agent in a **fresh, throwaway sub-session**. A session-scoped pending
# written during the request turn is therefore gone by the turn the human's
# approval arrives, so the handshake could never complete — the model would
# re-prompt forever. The requester (the verified user id the gateway
# forward-propagates into every sub-invocation) is the one identity that is
# both stable across turns and visible on both sides of the AgentTool
# boundary.
#
# Backends live in ``confirmation_store.py``: in-memory (single replica) or
# PostgreSQL (multi-replica / durable), selected by ORRERY_CONFIRMATION_BACKEND.
