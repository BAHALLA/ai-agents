"""Secret-shape patterns and the text redactor, in one place.

Two subsystems scrub the same kinds of secret out of free-form text: the
``PIIRedactionPlugin`` on the way out of a tool, and ``SecureMemoryService`` on
the way into long-term memory. They used to carry separate pattern lists, and the
memory list was the shorter one — it matched ``password=…`` and PEM blocks but
none of the bare provider tokens. A ``ghp_…`` pasted into chat was therefore
stored verbatim, and any later ``load_memory`` recall handed it back.

One list, one redactor, both callers. A pattern added for either path now covers
both, which is the only arrangement where "we redact provider tokens" stays true.

# Secret shapes inside free-form string values (log lines, config dumps, ...).
#
# Each entry pairs a pattern with the case-sensitive literals it cannot match
# without. Every pattern otherwise scans the full text, and on the multi-MiB log
# payloads this platform routinely handles that is the dominant cost of the
# whole after-tool chain — while the provider-token shapes almost never fire.
# ``"AKIA" in text`` is a memchr-style scan, far cheaper than running the regex
# engine over the same bytes, so an absent literal skips its pattern outright.
# Measured 2x faster on clean log text with byte-identical output.
#
# A literal here is a **correctness claim**: it must appear in every string the
# pattern can match. Anchor it on the fixed prefix, never on a character class.
# An empty tuple means "always run" — the right choice for the case-insensitive
# key=value pattern, whose triggers would need the text lowercased first (a full
# copy, which costs more than it saves).
