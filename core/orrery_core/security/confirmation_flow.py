"""Shared flow primitives for the guarded-tool confirmation handshake.

Every transport gate composes the same four steps from here — raise a pending,
render a blocked payload, enforce the requester-only rule, consume on retry
(via the store) — so the security-relevant rules (args-hash pinning, TTL,
approval validity, fail-closed refusal) exist exactly once. What stays in the
transports is genuinely transport-specific: UI rendering (text prompt, Chat
card, Slack blocks), decision capture (state stamp, thread reply, button
click), and the scope key a decision is matched under.
