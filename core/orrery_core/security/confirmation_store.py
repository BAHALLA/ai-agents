"""The platform-wide pending-confirmation store for guarded tools.

Every transport that gates ``@confirm``/``@destructive`` tools on a human
decision shares this store — the HTTP front door / persistent runner (strict
mode in ``guardrails.py``), the Google Chat bot (approval cards), and the
Slack bot (Block Kit buttons). Each pending guarded call is one
:class:`PendingConfirmation` keyed by a unique ``action_id`` and scoped by a
transport-chosen ``scope_key``:

- **requester** (the verified user id) for HTTP/CLI strict mode — which is
  also what enforces "only the person who triggered the action may approve";
- **thread / space / channel** for the chat bots, whose decision arrives as a
  card click or thread reply.

Pendings live *here* rather than in session state because guarded tools are
routinely reached through an ``AgentTool`` whose sub-session is throwaway — a
state-scoped pending written on the request turn is gone by the approval turn
(see the AgentTool-boundary regression in ``guardrails.py``).

Two flows over one surface:

- **Single-phase** (`consume_pending`) — the decision is stamped into the same
  turn that retries the tool (HTTP strict mode): one atomic check-and-remove.
- **Two-phase** (`mark_approved*` → `consume_approved`) — the decision is a
  separate transport event (card click / thread reply); the entry is marked
  approved, the runner re-enters, and the LLM's retry consumes the approval
  within :data:`_APPROVAL_VALIDITY` seconds.

Two backends, selected by ``ORRERY_CONFIRMATION_BACKEND``:

- ``memory`` (default) — correct only for a **single replica**: a pending
  raised on pod A is invisible to the pod that receives the approval, and it
  dies with the pod on restart.
- ``postgres`` — shares the handshake across replicas (and survives restarts)
  via the platform's existing ``DATABASE_URL``. One-shot guarantees ride the
  database: the consume/pop/mark variants resolve their target row inside one
  transaction, so two racing replicas cannot both consume a decision.

Traffic is human-scale (a handful of ~1 ms single-row statements around a
decision that takes seconds), so the sync engine has no measurable latency
cost inline in the callback path.
