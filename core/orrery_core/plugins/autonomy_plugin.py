"""AutonomyPlugin — graduated SRE autonomy levels (L2/L3/L4).

A secure, asymmetric guardrail over tool execution, orthogonal to RBAC: RBAC
answers *who* may act, autonomy answers *which mode this process runs in*. It
lets the same agent be deployed read-only for a new audience without touching
roles:

  - **L2 (read-only)** — fail-closed: only read tools or explicitly
    whitelisted tools run; every mutation is blocked.
  - **L3 (mutating SRE)** — fail-open for mutations except the irreversible,
    high-blast-radius ones (``@destructive`` / explicit blacklist), which are
    blocked.
  - **L4 (confirmed mutating)** — destructive tools are allowed only after an
    explicit human-in-the-loop confirmation (ADK-native
    ``request_confirmation``; supported by ``adk web``).

Read/mutate/destructive classification comes from the guardrail decorators —
the same source of truth RBAC uses: unmarked tools are read, ``@confirm`` marks
a mutation, ``@destructive`` marks an irreversible one. So the gate matches the
repo's real tool metadata instead of guessing from verb prefixes.

Blocked calls **return a structured deny result** rather than raising, so the
attempt flows through the rest of the plugin chain (metrics) and the model
receives a clean, actionable message instead of an unhandled exception. A call
merely *paused* on an L4 confirmation is reported as
:data:`STATUS_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION`, not :data:`STATUS_BLOCKED` — the model acts
on that string, and "blocked" reads as a dead end when the action is one human
answer away.

Opt-in: registered by ``default_plugins()`` only when an autonomy level is
configured (``autonomy_level=`` argument or the ``ORRERY_AUTONOMY_LEVEL`` env
var), so existing deployments are unchanged. It is registered **before**
``GuardrailsPlugin``: ADK's before-tool chain early-exits on the first non-None
return, so the reverse order let an L2 deployment raise a confirmation prompt for
a mutation the level would refuse the moment it was approved. The level is a
property of the process — decide it before asking a human anything.

A per-request override lives in session state, but only when written through
:func:`set_autonomy_level`; see :data:`AUTONOMY_LOCKED_STATE_KEY` for why a bare
value is ignored.
