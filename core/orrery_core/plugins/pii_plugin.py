"""PII / secret redaction for tool outputs (AEP-013).

``PIIRedactionPlugin`` scrubs credentials from every tool result before the
model, the session store, or any after-tool observer sees them. Two layers:

1. **Key-based**: dict entries whose key names a credential (``password``,
   ``access_token``, ``api_key``, ...) have their value replaced outright —
   the most reliable signal, immune to value-format drift.
2. **Pattern-based**: string values are scanned for well-known secret shapes
   (``password=...`` pairs, PEM blocks, AWS/GitHub/Slack/OpenAI token
   prefixes, JWTs) and matches are replaced in place.

Redaction **mutates the result in place and returns None** — deliberately.
ADK's after-tool chain early-exits on the first non-None return, so returning
a redacted copy would silence every observer registered later (audit outcome,
activity, metrics, output cap). Mutating the shared dict keeps the chain
intact while ensuring all downstream observers record the redacted values —
which is the point: the audit log must not carry secrets either. For the same
reason the plugin is registered *before* ``AuditPlugin`` in
``default_plugins()``.

Infrastructure identifiers (IP addresses) are **not** redacted by default —
an SRE agent that cannot see pod IPs or broker addresses cannot diagnose
anything. Opt in with ``redact_ips=True`` (``ORRERY_REDACT_IPS`` via
``default_plugins``) for compliance-bound deployments.
