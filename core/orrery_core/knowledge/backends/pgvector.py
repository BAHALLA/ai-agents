"""PostgreSQL + pgvector knowledge backend — hybrid semantic and lexical search.

Phase 2 of AEP-025. Where the Elasticsearch backend does BM25, this adds
semantics: "broker unreachable" finds a runbook titled "kafka node down", which
no lexical matcher can do.

**Hybrid, not pure vector.** Semantic search is weak exactly where SRE queries
are strongest — an exact identifier. A query for `CrashLoopBackOff` or a
specific consumer-group name wants the document containing that literal string,
and a nearest-neighbour search over embeddings will happily return three
plausible-sounding pages that never mention it. So both signals are computed
and fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, which combines rankings without needing
the two scores to be on a comparable scale (they are not: cosine distance and
``ts_rank_cd`` share no units).

Runs on the platform's existing PostgreSQL, but requires the ``pgvector``
extension — ``postgres:16-alpine`` does not have it; ``pgvector/pgvector:pg16``
does. That image swap is the reason this is phase 2 and Elasticsearch was
phase 1.
