"""Worker-thread sizing for the blocking tool layer.

Every tool in this platform is ``async def`` around a blocking client — the
Kubernetes and Kafka SDKs, ``requests``, the Docker CLI — offloaded with
``asyncio.to_thread`` / ``run_in_executor(None, ...)``. Both land on the event
loop's *default* executor, which asyncio sizes at ``min(32, os.cpu_count() + 4)``.

In a container that default is wrong in a way that is easy to miss:
``os.cpu_count()`` reports the **host's** processors, not the cgroup quota the
pod is actually limited to. On a 64-core node the pool is built for 32 threads
while the Helm chart caps the pod at ``1000m`` — one core. The threads are
mostly parked on network I/O, so a generous count is right in principle, but the
sizing should follow the CPU the process can really use, and it should be
knowable rather than accidental.

:func:`effective_cpu_count` reads the cgroup (v2, then v1) before falling back
to the stdlib, and :func:`configure_default_executor` installs a pool sized from
it. Override with ``ORRERY_MAX_WORKER_THREADS`` when a deployment knows better.
