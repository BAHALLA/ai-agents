"""Slack-aware confirmation callback for guarded tools.

Replaces the CLI-based require_confirmation() with Slack interactive buttons.
When a guarded tool is invoked, posts a Block Kit message with Approve/Deny
buttons and records the pending action in the platform confirmation store
(``orrery_core``). The button click is handled in app.py / socket_mode.py:
Approve marks the pending approved (requester-only, fail-closed) and re-enters
the runner with a synthetic "proceed" message; on the LLM's retry the callback
consumes the approved entry by ``(scope, tool_name, args_hash)`` within the
shared validity window — so an approval is one-shot, pinned to the exact
arguments it was granted for, and survives an ADK ``AgentTool`` sub-agent
whose session state does not propagate to the parent.

Store, backends (memory | postgres via ``ORRERY_CONFIRMATION_BACKEND``),
TTL / approval validity, args-hash pinning, and the requester-only rule all
live in ``orrery_core`` — shared with the Google Chat bot and the HTTP strict
mode. This module keeps only what is Slack-specific: the Block Kit rendering,
the channel/thread scope mapping, and the button-posting callback.
