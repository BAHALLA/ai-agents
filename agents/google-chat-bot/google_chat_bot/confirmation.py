"""Google Chat confirmation flow for guarded tools.

When a guarded tool fires, ``google_chat_confirmation`` short-circuits the
call, appends a Card v2 to a request-scoped buffer, and records the pending
action in the platform confirmation store (``orrery_core``). The handler
returns the buffered card as part of the synchronous webhook response — no
Chat REST client needed. When the user clicks Approve/Deny (or replies
``approve``/``deny`` in the thread) the handler marks the matching pending as
approved (or pops it on deny) and re-enters the runner with a synthetic user
message that includes the original arguments. On the retry the callback
consumes the approved entry by ``(scope, tool_name, args_hash)`` — so the
handshake survives an ADK ``AgentTool`` sub-agent that does not propagate
per-call state to the parent session.

Store, backends (memory | postgres via ``ORRERY_CONFIRMATION_BACKEND``),
args-hash pinning, TTL / approval validity, and the requester-only rule all
live in ``orrery_core`` — shared with the Slack bot and the HTTP strict mode.
This module keeps only what is Chat-specific: the card buffer, the scope
mapping (thread → space fallback), and the card-emitting callback.
