"""Root orchestrator for the orrery assistant (ADK 2.0).

The interactive root is ``orrery_chat_agent`` — a conversational chat-mode
``LlmAgent`` that routes free-form queries to specialist agents via ``AgentTool``
and delegates broad "run a triage" requests to ``incident_triage_agent``. This is
the standard ADK 2.0 coordinator pattern; a chat-mode agent must be the root (ADK
forbids it as a routed node inside a graph).

The deterministic, parallel, bounded-loop pipeline lives in
``orrery_triage_workflow`` (a graph ``Workflow``) as a separate batch/scheduled
entrypoint — `make run-triage` — because a ``Workflow`` cannot be a sub-agent or
``AgentTool`` of the chat coordinator. Both reuse the same node agents. See ADR-003.
