"""Closed-loop remediation nodes for the graph-based Workflow root.

Provides the remediation subgraph building blocks: an actor, a verifier, a
deterministic routing function, and a summarizer. The act -> verify -> retry
loop is wired by the Workflow graph in ``agent.py`` via a ``RoutingMap``:

    remediation_actor -> remediation_verifier -> verify_route
        -> {"retry": remediation_actor, "done": remediation_summarizer}

``verify_route`` replaces ADK 1.x's ``LoopAgent`` (max_iterations) + ``exit_loop``
(``actions.escalate``): the verifier signals success by calling
``mark_remediation_resolved``, and ``verify_route`` enforces the iteration cap.
See ADR-003.

RBAC: The remediation actor inherits the guardrails from the tools it calls
(@destructive, @confirm), so only operator/admin roles can trigger destructive
actions inside the loop.
